如果上面说的都符合你，那么继续阅读。

## Section 1: Get the [Source Code](source-code.html)

## 第一节：获取[源码](source-code.html)

Before you can get started, you'll need to get a copy of the ESLint source code. This section explains how to do that and a little about the source code structure.

在你开始之前，你需要获取ESLint的源码。本节解释如何获取源码和源码结构。

## Section 2: Setup a [Development Environment](development-environment.html)

## 第二节： 设置[开发环境](development-environment.html)

Developing for ESLint is a bit different than running it on the command line. This section shows you how to setup a development environment and get you ready to write code.
