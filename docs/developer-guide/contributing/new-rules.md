# New Rules

# 新建规则

ESLint is all about rules. For most of the project's lifetime, we've had over 100 rules, and that list continues to grow. However, we can't just accept any proposed rule because all rules need to work cohesively together. As such, we have some guidelines around which rules can be part of the ESLint core and which are better off as custom rules and plugins.

ESLint 的核心就是规则。在该项目的生命周期的大部分时间里，我们已经创建了超过100条规则，而且数量还在持续增加。然而，我们不能一味地接受这些提出的规则，我们需要这些规则在一起能协同工作。因此，对于哪些规则可以成为 ESLint 核心的一部分，哪些规则更适合作为自定义的规则和插件，我们制定了一些准则。

## Core Rule Guidelines

## 核心规则指南

In general, ESLint core rules must be:

一般而言，ESLint 核心规则必须是：

1. **Widely applicable.** The rules we distribute need to be of importance to a large number of developers. Individual preferences for uncommon patterns are not supported.

1. **适用广泛。** 我们发布的规则重点针对于大众的开发者，不支持小众的个人偏好。

1. **Generic.** Rules cannot be so specific that users will have trouble understanding when to use them. A rule is typically too specific if describing what it does requires more than two "and"s (if a and b and c and d, then this rule warns).

1. **通用性。** 规则不能太具体而导致用户使用过程中产生误解。如果一条规则需要两个以上的“and”来描述，那么它通常就是太具体了(if a and b and c and d, then this rule warns)。

1. **Atomic.** Rules must function completely on their own. Rules are expressly forbidden from knowing about the state or presence of other rules.

1. **原子性** 规则必须能独自运行。在一个规则中获知其他规则的状态是明令禁止的。

1. **Unique.** No two rules can produce the same warning. Overlapping rules confuse end users and there is an expectation that core ESLint rules do not overlap.

1. **唯一性。** 没有两条规则可以产生相同的警告。重叠的规则会混淆使用者而且我们也希望核心的 ESLint 规则不重叠。

1. **Library agnostic.** Rules must be based solely on JavaScript runtime environments and not on specific libraries or frameworks. For example, core rules shouldn't only apply if you're using jQuery but we may have some rules that apply only if you're using Node.js (a runtime).

1. **类库无关。**  规则必须完全基于 JavaScript 运行时环境，而不是特定的类库或者框架。比如，核心规则不应该仅仅适用于 jQuery ，然而我们可能有一些规则仅仅适用于 Node.js。

1. **No conflicts.** No rule must directly conflict with another rule. For example, if we have a rule requiring semicolons, we cannot also have a rule disallowing semicolons (which is why we have one rule, `semi`, that does both).

1. **无冲突。** 规则之间绝对不能有直接的冲突。举个例子，如果我们有一个规则要求分号，我们就不会有另外一个规则禁用分号（这就是为什么我们有一个 `semi` 规则，可以同时满足这两种需求）。

Even though these are the formal criteria for inclusion, each rule is evaluated on its own basis.

尽管这些准则是核心规则入选的正式标准，each rule is evaluated on its own basis。

## Proposing a Rule

## 提出一个规则

If you want to propose a new rule, [create an issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/new?body=**When%20does%20this%20rule%20warn%3F%20Please%20describe%20and%20show%20example%20code%3A**%0A%0A**Is%20this%20rule%20preventing%20an%20error%20or%20is%20it%20stylistic%3F**%0A%0A**Why%20is%20this%20rule%20a%20candidate%20for%20inclusion%20instead%20of%20creating%20a%20custom%20rule%3F**%0A%0A**Are%20you%20willing%20to%20create%20the%20rule%20yourself%3F**%0A%0A) be sure to include:

如果你想提出一条新规则，[新建一个议题（issue）](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/new?body=**When%20does%20this%20rule%20warn%3F%20Please%20describe%20and%20show%20example%20code%3A**%0A%0A**Is%20this%20rule%20preventing%20an%20error%20or%20is%20it%20stylistic%3F**%0A%0A**Why%20is%20this%20rule%20a%20candidate%20for%20inclusion%20instead%20of%20creating%20a%20custom%20rule%3F**%0A%0A**Are%20you%20willing%20to%20create%20the%20rule%20yourself%3F**%0A%0A) 请确保包含以下几点：


1. When the rule will warn. Include a description as well as sample code.
1. 该规则在什么时候发出警告。请包含示例代码及相关描述。
1. Whether the rule prevents an error or is stylistic.
1. 该规则是避免产生一个错误，还是风格上的？
1. Why the rule should be in the core instead of creating a custom rule.
1. 为什么该规则应该是核心规则而不是一个自定义规则。
1. Are you willing to create the rule yourself?
1. 你愿意自己创建这条规则吗？

We need all of this information in order to determine whether or not the rule is a good core rule candidate.

我们需要所有这些信息来判断它是否满足核心规则的候选要求。

## Resource Limitations

## 资源限制

Please keep in mind that we receive a lot of rule proposals and the ESLint team is completely a volunteer team that works in its free time to maintain ESLint. As a result, even if we like the idea for a rule, we may not have the resources to implement it. You greatly increase the likelihood of getting a new core rule into ESLint if you are willing to implement it yourself. The team is very good at guiding first-time contributors through the rule creation process.

我们收到了许多规则提案，而且ESLint 团队是一支完全由志愿者组成的团队，我们只能利用业余时间维护 ESLint。因此，即使我们喜欢某条规则的想法，我们可能没有人力去实现它。如果你愿意自己实现这条规则，这将会大大增加它成为 ESLint 核心规则的可能性。这个团队非常善于指导初次次贡献者完成规则创建过程。

## Creating Your Own Rules

## 创建你自己的规则

Remember that ESLint is completely pluggable, which means you can create your own rules and distribute them using plugins. We did this on purpose because we don't want to be the gatekeepers for all possible rules. Even if we don't accept a rule into the core, that doesn't mean you can't have the exact rule that you want. See the [working with rules](../working-with-rules) and [working with plugins](../working-with-plugins) documentation for more information.

ESLint 是完全插件化的，这意味着你可以创建自己的规则，然后以插件的方式进行发布。我们之所以这么做是因为我们不想给所有可能的规则都设置一个门槛。即使这条规则不能成为为核心规则，那也并不意味着你不能拥有自己想要的规则。你可以从[working with rules](../working-with-rules) 和[working with plugins](../working-with-plugins) 的文档中查看更多相关信息。
