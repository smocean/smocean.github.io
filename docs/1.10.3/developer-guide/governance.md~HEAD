# Governance

# 管理

ESLint is an open source project that depends on contributions from the community. Anyone may contribute to the project at any time by submitting code, participating in discussions, making suggestions, or any other contribution they see fit. This document describes how various types of contributors work within the ESLint project.

ESLint是依赖社区贡献的开源项目。任何人都可以通过提交代码、参与讨论、提出建议或者其他适合的方式做出贡献。本文档描述了不同类型的贡献者如何在ESLint项目中工作。

## Roles and Responsibilities

## 角色与义务

### Users

### 用户

Users are community members who have a need for the project. Anyone can be a User; there are no special requirements. Common User contributions include evangelizing the project (e.g., display a link on a website and raise awareness through word-of-mouth), informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective, or providing moral support (a "thank you" goes a long way).

用户为对该项目有需求的社区成员。所有人都可以成为用户，并且没有任何特殊的需求。普遍用户的贡献包括宣传该项目（例如在网站上展示链接或者通过口碑吸引注意），从新用户的角度告知开发者优缺点，或者提供道义上的支持（感谢长期的发展）。

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such Users may find themselves becoming Contributors, as described in the next section.

继续与该项目和社区打交道的用户会越来越多的参与其中。这样的用户会发展自己成为的贡献者，就像下节描述的那样。

### Contributors

### 贡献者

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project, most often in the form of code and/or documentation. Anyone can become a Contributor, and contributions can take many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements, and no selection process.

贡献者为以具体的方式做出贡献的社区成员，大部分以代码或文档的方式。所有人都可以成为贡献者，并且贡献的方式有许多种。该项目没有期望的承诺，不要求特定的技能，也没有筛选程序。

Contributors have read-only access to source code and so submit changes via pull requests. Contributor pull requests have their contribution reviewed and merged by a Reviewer. Reviewers and Committers work with Contributors to review their code and prepare it for merging.

贡献者对源码有只读的权限，通过pull requests提交更改。贡献者的pull requests会有审阅，并由审阅者合并。审阅者和提交者与贡献者合作来审阅代码并准备将其合并。

As Contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for committership by an existing Committer.

贡献者获得体验并对项目熟悉，重视并投入，社区就会获得发展。在某个阶段，他们发现自己被现有的提交者提名为committership。

### Committers

### 提交者

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Committers are given push access to the project's GitHub repos and must abide by the project's [Contribution Guidelines](contributing).

提交者是社区成员，他们已经表现出通过不断的参与到社区致力于项目的持续发展。提交者对该项目的git仓库授权了push权限，且必须遵守项目的 [贡献指南](contributing).

Committers:

提交者：

* Are expected to work on public branches of the source repository and submit pull requests from that branch to the master branch.

* 希望在资源库的公共分支工作，并且从这个分支向master分支提交pull requests。

* Are expected to delete their public branches when they are no longer necessary.

* 希望其当不在需要的时候删除公共的分支。

* May submit small changes (documentation updates, changes to tests or code comments, configuration changes) without pull requests.

* 可以不通过pull requests提交小的修改（文档更新、修改测试或代码注释、修改配置）。

* Must submit pull requests for any non-trivial changes.

* 必须对重要的修改提交 pull requests 。

* Have their work reviewed by Reviewers before acceptance into the repository.

* 在合并到仓库必须被审阅者审阅代码。

* May label issues as they are submitted ("accepted" label should only be added for bugs, and only if the committer verified the bug as valid).

* 随着他们的提交可能标记问题（仅为bug添加"accepted" 标签，并且提交者确认为bug）。

* May close issues if they are duplicates of already resolved issues.

* 如果已经解决的问题则可能关闭问题。

To become a Committer:

成为一个提交者：

* One must have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential Committer will need to show that they have an understanding of and alignment with the project, its objectives, and its strategy.

* 必须展示已参与到项目中的成员的意愿和能力。一般来说，一个潜在的提交者需要表现其从客观和策略的角度对与项目紧密合作的理解。

* Committers are expected to be respectful of every community member and to work collaboratively in the spirit of inclusion.

* 提交者希望被每一个社区成员尊重，且以包容协同的精神工作。

* Have submitted a minimum of 10 qualifying pull requests. What's a qualifying pull request? One that carries significant technical weight and requires little effort to accept because it's well documented and tested.

* 至少提交了10条合格的pull requests。什么是合格的pull requests呢？需要是有技术含量且有很好的文档和测试，和容易被接受。

New Committers can be nominated by any existing Committer. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the Reviewers.

新的提交者可以被已有的提交者提名。一定被提名，他将被审阅者投票。

It is important to recognize that committership is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned and once earned it can be removed by the Reviewers in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances committership exists for as long as the Committer wishes to continue engaging with the project.

意识到提交者的身份是一种特权但不是权利是非常重要的。这种特权必须要争取，一旦争取它可以在极端的情况下被审阅者移除。但是，正常情况下，这种特权如果提交者愿意继续参与项目将会长期存在。

A Committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project, particularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may be nominated to become a Reviewer, described below.

展现了对项目中上水平的的贡献的提交者，特别对战略方向和长期健康发展，可能被提名为审阅者，下面为描述。

### Reviewers

### 审阅者

Reviewers have additional responsibilities over and above those of a Committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. Reviewers are expected to review code contributions, approve changes to this document, and manage the copyrights within the project outputs.

相比于提交者，审阅者有额外的责任。他们要确保项目的顺利发展。审阅者要审阅代码，批准文档的修改，并且管理项目输出的版权。

Reviewers fulfill all requirements of Committers, and also:

审阅者要满足所有提交者的要求，还有：

* Contributions can be reviewed by other Reviewers, but this is not explicitly required.

* 贡献可以被其他的审阅者审阅，但这不是明确要求的。

* May merge external pull requests for accepted issues upon reviewing and approving the changes.

* 审查和批准更改后，可以接受合并外部的pull request。

* May merge their own pull requests once they have collected the feedback they deem necessary. (No pull request should be merged without at least one Committer/Reviewer comment stating they've looked at the code.)

当他们收集了认为必要的反馈后可以合并自己的 pull request。（没有提交者/审阅者看过代码且评论的pull request不应该合并）。

To become a Reviewer:

成为审阅者：

* Reviewers are expected to work in a helpful and collaborative way with the community.

* 审阅者要以有益且协同的方式与社区合作。

* Have given good feedback on others' submissions and displayed an overall understanding of the code quality standards for the project.

*  对其他人的意见有良好的反馈方式，并且展示对项目代码质量的整体理解。

* Have submitted a minimum of 50 qualifying pull requests.

* 至少提交了50条合格的pull request。

A Committer is invited to become a Reviewer by existing Reviewers. A nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by the existing Reviewers.

提交者被已有的审阅者提名成为审阅者。提名将被讨论并且被已有的审阅者投票。

### Project Lead

### 项目领导者

Project Leads have additional responsibilities over and above those of a Reviewer. These responsibilities include administration of a GitHub repo, management and scheduling of releases, publish access to npm, issue and milestone tracking (including closing of all issues for any reason), and setting the direction for the project. Project Leads must also ensure the continued development of the project they oversee by nominating Committers and Reviewers for the project, contributing code, maintaining a roadmap, and being a community representative for the project.

相比于审阅者项目，领导者有着额外的责任。他们的责任包括管理 GitHub的仓库，管理和调度发布，发布到npm，问题和milestone跟踪（包括关闭问题的理由），并要为项目设立发展方向。项目领导也必须保证持续发展，他们负责提交者和审阅者的贡献代码，维护一个路线图，并成为项目的社区代表。

There are two ways someone can become a Project Lead. First, when an outside project is accepted into the ESLint organization, the person who has been maintaining that project will be the Project Lead. Any community member can suggest a project be included in the ESLint organization.

有两种方式可以成为项目领导者。第一，当一个外部项目参与ESLint组织，负责维护那个项目的人就会成为项目领导者。所有社区成员都可以建议一个项目融入到ESLint组织。

Second, a Reviewer can be invited to become a Project Lead by an existing Project Lead. An existing Reviewer may be considered for Project Lead status only after they have submitted 75 qualifying pull requests and have been active on the project for a period of at least six months. Project Leads are expected to be exceptional community leaders who work in a helpful, inclusive, and supportive way with others. A nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by existing Project Leads.

第二，审阅者可以被已有的项目领导者邀请成为领导者。已有的审阅者可以成为领导者的前提是至少提交了75条合格的pull request且积极参与项目的时间不少于6个月。希望项目领导者是特殊的领导者，可以以有益的，包容和支持的方式与他人合作。提名为领导者会被已有的领导者讨论并投票决定。

### Administrator

### 管理员

Administrators oversee the ESLint organization as a whole. They are responsible for administering the GitHub organization, domain name, mailing list, social media presence, and website. Administrators need not be Project Leads but must have been Project Leads at one point in time.


管理员监督ESLint组织作为一个整体。他们是负责管理GitHub组织、域名、邮件列表，在社交媒体和网站。管理员不需要是领导项目，但必须在一个时间点做过项目领导者。


Administrators oversee the efforts of Project Leads to help organize efforts around projects. They seek out new resources and tools to help the projects work more effectively and represent the organization. Administrators work within the community to understand requirements and reach out through efforts such as fundraising, organizing meetings, instituting policies, and more.


管理员监督项目的成果，帮助组织围绕项目努力。他们寻求新的资源和工具，以帮助项目更有效地工作和组织的代表。管理员的对社区的工作要理解需求并通过如筹款、组织会议、制定政策等努力达到目标。


A Project Lead can be invited to become an Administrator by an existing Administrator. An existing Project Lead must have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the ESLint organization as a whole, the community, and collaboration. A nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by existing Administrators.

项目的领导可以由一个现有的管理员邀请成为一个管理者。现有的项目负责人必须具备一个长期致力于ESLint组织作为一个整体，社区和合作。提名将被讨论，然后由现有的管理员投票。
