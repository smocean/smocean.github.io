# Disallow Global Object Function Calls (no-obj-calls)

ECMAScript provides several global objects that are intended to be used as-is. Some of these objects look as if they could be constructors due their capitalization (such as `Math` and `JSON`) but will throw an error if you try to execute them as functions.

The [ECMAScript 5 specification](http://es5.github.io/#x15.8) makes it clear that both `Math` and `JSON` cannot be invoked:

> The Math object does not have a `[[Call]]` internal property; it is not possible to invoke the Math object as a function.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at preventing the accidental calling of global objects as functions.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-obj-calls: 2*/

var x = Math(); /*error 'Math' is not a function.*/
var y = JSON(); /*error 'JSON' is not a function.*/
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint no-obj-calls: 2*/

var x = math();
var y = json();
```
