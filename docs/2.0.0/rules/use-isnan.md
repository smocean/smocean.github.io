# Require isNaN() (use-isnan)

In JavaScript, `NaN` is a special value of the `Number` type. It's used to represent any of the "not-a-number" values represented by the double-precision 64-bit format as specified by the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. `NaN` has the unique property of not being equal to anything, including itself. That is to say, that the condition `NaN !== NaN` evaluates to true.

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at eliminating potential errors as the result of comparing against the special value `NaN`.

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/*eslint use-isnan: 2*/

if (foo == NaN) { /*error Use the isNaN function to compare with NaN.*/
    // ...
}

if (foo != NaN) { /*error Use the isNaN function to compare with NaN.*/
    // ...
}
```

The following patterns are not considered problems:

```js
/*eslint use-isnan: 2*/

if (isNaN(foo)) {
    // ...
}

if (isNaN(NaN)) {
    // ...
}
```
